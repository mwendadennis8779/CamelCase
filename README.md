# CamelCase

## Challenge 1: CamelCase Method(Toy Problem)
Write simple .camelCase method for strings. All words must have their first letter capitalized without spaces.

For instance:

'hello case'.camelcase => HelloCase

'camel case word'.camelcase => CamelCaseWord

This method is defined on the String class, which means that it can be called on any string object. The method splits the string into an array of words, capitalizes the first letter of each word, and then joins the words back together into a single string.
